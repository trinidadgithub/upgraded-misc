This project is python port of the classic Star Trek game originally written for BASIC on the mainframe.

I have reviewed the C code for the Star Trek game. We can begin porting it to Python by first understanding the major components and data structures used in the C program. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the key elements:
Key Features and Structure:

- Game Setup and Initialization:
        Functions like intro(), new_game(), and initialize() set up the game state and prompt the player.

- Game Loop:
        The game operates in a continuous loop, processing user commands and updating the game state accordingly.

- Core Mechanics:
        Various game functions handle ship navigation, combat with Klingons, damage control, and scanning sectors.

- Data Structures:
        Structures and arrays are used to represent the map, ship status, Klingon ships, and other game elements.

Plan for Porting:

- Initial Setup:
        Create Python classes or data structures to represent the ship, map, and Klingons.

- Functions and Flow:
        Convert key functions to Python, using standard Python syntax for reading input, printing outputs, and handling loops.

- Modular Approach:
        Implement individual game functions like new_game(), course_control(), and phaser_control() as Python functions or methods within classes.

- Testing and Iteration:
        Test each ported function to ensure it behaves as expected before integrating it into the main game loop.

**History:** Below is a history of the game ported from BASIC to C.  You can find this at [this repo here](https://github.com/EtchedPixels/FUZIX/blob/master/Applications/games/startrek.c).  Enjoy!

 *	- Removed all floating point
 *	- Fixed multiple bugs in the BASIC to C conversion
 *	- Fixed a couple of bugs in the BASIC that either got in during it's
 *	  conversion between BASICs or from the original trek
 *	- Put it on a diet to get it to run in 32K. No features were harmed
 *	  in the making of this code smaller.
 *
 * TODO:
 *	- Look hard at all the rounding cases
 *	- Review some of the funnies in the BASIC code that appear to be bugs
 *	  either in the conversion or between the original and 'super' trek
 *	  Notably need to fix the use of shield energy directly for warp
 *	- Find a crazy person to draw ascii art bits we can showfile for things
 *	  like messages from crew/docking/klingons etc
 *	- I think it would make a lot of sense to switch to real angles, but
 *	  trek game traditionalists might consider that heresy.

### Implementation
Currently, navigation and short range scans have been implemented.  Also, if you navigate to a Star Base, your ship will be repaired, refueled and resupplied.

### Next Steps

- **Implement Command Handling:** Add functionality to handle basic player commands (e.g., navigation, phaser control, long-range scans).

- **Combat Mechanics:** Implement functions for phaser control and firing photon torpedoes.

- **Damage and Repair System:** Create logic for handling damage to the ship and repairs.

- **Long-Range Scans:** Implement a function to show an overview of adjacent quadrants.

- **Game End Conditions:** Define victory and defeat conditions based on completing objectives or losing the ship.
